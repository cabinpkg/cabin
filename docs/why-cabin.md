# Why Cabin?

C++ is often considered a complex language and unconsciously avoided by many.  The absence of a definitive package manager and the unfamiliar syntax of build systems like [CMake](https://cmake.org) make it seem difficult to set up a C++ environment, leaving people hesitant.

To simplify the process and allow users to develop applications and libraries without worrying about [CMake](https://cmake.org), I created a package manager and build system with an intuitive interface, similar to [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo). This allows developers to focus on learning C++ without any hindrances. Additionally, I aim to integrate with other build systems and package managers, providing a seamless transition between development environments.
