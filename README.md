## Installation

### Easy install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://sh.poac.pm | bash
```
*When your OS is macOS, use [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew)*

### Manual install (Build)

Poac requires the following tools and packages to build:
* [`cmake`](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake): `3.0` or higher
* [`boost`](https://github.com/boostorg): `1.66.0` or higher
* [`openssl`](https://github.com/openssl/openssl): as new as possible
* [`yaml-cpp`](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp): `0.6.0` or higher

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/poacpm/poac.git
$ cd poac
$ mkdir build && cd $_
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install
```

<!--
If poac is already installed, you can build using poac:
```bash
$ poac build
```
-->

### Runtime requirements

* compiler (GCC | Clang | MSVC | ICC)
* `tar`: in publish command
* `dot(graphviz)`: in graph command
* `git`: in install command
* `cmake`: optional
* `make`: optional

## Why poac?

I often see that C++ was said to be a difficult language, and I saw many people who shun it just because of C++.
It was thought that it is hard to construct an environment, there is no definitive package manager, and the strange syntax of the build system [CMake](https://cmake.org), etc. is the cause that makes us feel hesitant.

By developing a package manager and build system that has an intuitive and easy-to-use interface like [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo), and users can develop applications and libraries without being aware of [CMake](https://cmake.org), you can focus on learning C++ without being stumble.
I also plan to implement integration with many other build systems and package managers, so you should be able to switch seamlessly.
