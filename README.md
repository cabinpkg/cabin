## Description

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Poac is still under development and may contain a bunch of bugs.

Poac (pronounced as `/pəʊək/`) is a package manager and build system for C++ users, inspired by Cargo for Rust.

Poac can download project's dependencies and compile a project.
Please visit [poac.dev](https://poac.dev) and [The Poac Book](https://doc.poac.dev) for more details.

## Demo

By using Poac, you can create a C++ project, build sources, and execute an application:

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26405363/169694620-2e3f769e-c6c5-4e6a-a645-e5bae226a8cb.gif)

## Hello World

You can get started with just a few commands as the demo shows. Let's create a new Poac project as follows:

```console
you:~$ poac create hello_world
     Created binary (application) `hello_world` package
```

Then, you can use the `poac run` command to run your application:

```console
you:~$ cd hello_world
you:~/hello_world$ poac run
   Compiling 1/1: hello_world v0.1.0 (/Users/you/hello_world)
    Finished debug target(s) in 0.90s
     Running `/Users/you/hello_world/poac-out/debug/hello_world`
Hello, world!
```

## Supported Operating Systems

</details>

Once you have all the necessary requirements in place, you can proceed to build Poac by executing the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poac-dev/poac.git
cd poac
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DPOAC_BUILD_TESTING=OFF
cd build
ninja
ninja install
```

Poac attempts to utilize locally installed dependencies by default. To bypass the use of local packages, you can specify `-DCPM_USE_LOCAL_PACKAGES=OFF` as an option for the `cmake` command.

## Usage

### Start a new project with Poac

The `poac create` command lets you start a new Poac project:

```console
you:~$ poac create hello_world
     Created binary (application) `hello_world` package
```

> [!TIP]
> If you want to integrate your existing project with Poac, use the `init` command:
> 
> ```console
> you:~/your-pj$ poac init
>      Created binary (application) `your-pj` package
> ```
> 
> This command just creates a `poac.toml` file not to break your project.

### Build the project

In most cases, you will want to execute a binary as well as build the project—of course, you can.

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac run
   Compiling 1/1: hello_world v0.1.0 (/Users/you/hello_world)
    Finished debug target(s) in 0.90s
     Running `/Users/you/hello_world/poac-out/debug/hello_world`
Hello, world!
```

Should you just build it, run the `build` command:

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac build
    Finished debug target(s) in 0.21s
```

Poac uses a cache since we executed the command with no changes.

### Install dependencies

Like Cargo for Rust does, Poac installs dependencies at build time.
However, Poac does not support [weired version specifiers](https://stackoverflow.com/q/22343224), such as `~` and `^`.
You can specify dependencies like:

`poac.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
"boost/bind" = ">=1.64.0 and <2.0.0"
```

We regularly avoid auto updating packages to major versions which bring breaking changes, but minor and patch are acceptable.

> [!TIP]
> If you would use a specific version, you can write the version like the following:
>
> ```toml
> [dependencies]
> "boost/bind" = "1.66.0"
> ```

#### Conan V1 Registry

Poac also supports Conan V1 Registry. To use it:

`poac.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
fmt = { version = "9.1.0", registry = "conan-v1" }
spdlog = { version = "1.10.0", registry = "conan-v1" }
leveldb = { version = "1.23", registry = "conan-v1" }
```

*The demo is publised on [wx257osn2/poac-conan-demo](https://github.com/wx257osn2/poac-conan-demo)*

After editing `poac.toml`, executing the `build` command will install the package and its dependencies.

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac build
   Resolving dependencies ...
 Downloading packages ...
  Downloaded boost/bind v1.66.0
  Downloaded boost/core v1.66.0
  Downloaded boost/assert v1.66.0
  Downloaded boost/config v1.66.0
   Compiling 1/1: hello_world v0.1.0 (/Users/you/hello_world)
    Finished debug target(s) in 0.70s
```

To use this dependency, update the `main.cpp` file.

`src/main.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <boost/bind.hpp>

int f(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  std::cout << boost::bind(f, 5, _1)(10) << std::endl;
}
```

You can now run this source code:

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac run
   Compiling 1/1: hello_world v0.1.0 (/Users/you/hello_world)
    Finished debug target(s) in 0.50s
     Running `/Users/you/hello_world/poac-out/debug/hello_world`
15
```

> [!WARNING]
> We currently support building a project with header-only dependencies.
> Building with build-required dependencies will be soon supported.

### Create a dependency graph

You can create a dependency graph by using the `graph` command:

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac graph -o out.png
   Generated out.png
```

![Dependency Graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26405363/173274015-9fd4869d-94cf-4667-b07f-8e9fd94a02a6.png)

Or you can export the graph as a `.dot` file:

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac graph -o out.dot
   Generated out.dot
```

```dot
digraph G {
0[label="boost/bind: 1.66.0"];
1[label="boost/config: 1.66.0"];
2[label="boost/core: 1.66.0"];
3[label="boost/assert: 1.66.0"];
0->2 ;
0->1 ;
2->3 ;
2->1 ;
3->1 ;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> When you want to export the graph as a `.png` file, please ensure `graphviz` is installed.

If you omit specifying the output path, then Poac emits the graph to standard output:

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac graph
boost/bind -> boost/core
boost/bind -> boost/config
boost/core -> boost/assert
boost/core -> boost/config
boost/assert -> boost/config
```

### Run linter

Linting source code is essential to protect its quality.
Poac supports linting it by a simple command with `cpplint`:

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac lint
     Linting hello_world
src/main.cpp:0:  No copyright message found.  You should have a line: "Copyright [year] <Copyright Owner>"  [legal/copyright] [5]
Done processing src/main.cpp
Total errors found: 1

Error: `cpplint` completed with exit code 1
```

> [!TIP]
> If you do not have `cpplint`, install it with the following command:
>
> ```bash
> pip install cpplint
> ```

The `lint` command works without configurations, and Poac would automatically opt out of unwanted lints by adjusting to each project.
To customize the lint settings, try adding the `[lint.cpplint]` key in your `poac.toml` like [this](https://github.com/poac-dev/poac/blob/cc30b706fb49860903384df56d650a0955aca16c/poac.toml#L67-L83)
or creating a [`CPPLINT.cfg`](https://github.com/poac-dev/poac/blob/5e7e3792e8818d165149214e94f30958fb0fef66/CPPLINT.cfg) file to the repository root.

### Run formatter

Poac also supports formatting your source code with `clang-format`.
Ensure having installed `clang-format` before running this command.

```console
you:~/hello_world$ poac fmt
  Formatting hello_world
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command automatically detects what files we need to format to avoid bothering commands like:
>
> ```console
> $ # We need to avoid the `build` dir and such dirs ...
> $ clang-format ./src/*.cpp -i
> $ clang-format ./include/**/*.hpp -i
> $ clang-format ./tests/**/*.cpp -i
> $ ...
> ```

To customize the format settings, try creating a [`.clang-format`](/.clang-format) file to the repository root.

### Search packages

In case you would find what packages are provided, you can use the `search` command or visit [poac.dev](https://poac.dev).

```console
$ poac search func
boost/function = "1.66.0"               # Boost.org function module
boost/function_types = "1.66.0"         # Boost.org function_types module
boost/functional = "1.66.0"             # Boost.org functional module
```

## Why Poac?

C++ is often considered a complex language and unconsciously avoided by many. The absence of a definitive package manager and the unfamiliar syntax of build systems like [CMake](https://cmake.org) make it seem difficult to set up a C++ environment, leaving people hesitant.

To simplify the process and allow users to develop applications and libraries without worrying about [CMake](https://cmake.org), I created a package manager and build system with an intuitive interface, similar to [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo). This allows developers to focus on learning C++ without any hindrances. Additionally, I aim to integrate with other build systems and package managers, providing a seamless transition between development environments.

### Naming Background

Poac is originated from `cpp` but designed to prioritize ease of typing and reduce strain on one hand as it will be frequently used as a command. Its name is ergonomically optimized to prevent the development of tenosynovitis.

<img width="1230" alt="ergo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26405363/169741684-ecb8aaad-2599-45ae-a680-a26f11652132.png">

Despite C++ often being overlooked for product development, I believe that Poac can help to promote it as a fun language. Amemiya and Mizutani argue that the sound of `/p/` is associated with a bright and soft impression among Japanese consonants (157)[^1]. In the same way, I believe that Poac's name can convey a similarly positive impression.
